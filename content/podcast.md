Engineering leaders often lack empathy towards Product Management. 

I decided to talk to PMs in B2B space to understand the art and science of Product Management. 

[Product Pupil](https://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/vCoi8Ojm3zb)  is a recording of some of those conversations.

While I continue to learn B2B product management. The podcast was stopped after few episodes.
